				<div class="title"> Data Visualization at Mastercard</div>
				<div class="body">
					<p>This summer, I interned for Mastercard’s Data and Analytics team within the Corporate Finance Department. <b>My work was primarily focused on making Mastercard’s internal data more understandable </b> by creating interactive Tableau Workbooks.</p>

					<p><b>My main project revolved around visualizing Mastercard’s professional spending</b>, and creating an interactive dashboard that allowed for business leaders and executives to investigate spending trends at a high level, and then pass off the workbook to analysts with more domain expertise who would then analyze the spending at an invoice level. </p>

 					<p>I also created a workbook displaying how new product ideas moved through Mastercard’s product pipeline, a dashboard visualizing orientation feedback, and a dashboard visualizing the Transaction Services team’s rate of success in meeting their performance goals.</p>

					<p><b>Unfortunately, I can’t show any of the dashboards that I made because they all contain sensitive information</b>.If you’re specifically interested in any of these projects,<b>  feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ryanrodriguez4532@gmail.com?subject=website" class="black-me">ryanrodriguez4532@gmail.com </a></b>. Given that I can't actually show any of the dashboards or workbooks, I think communicating the process behind each would be a lot more effective through conversation, either over email, the phone, or in person.</p>

					<p>Additionally, here is a link to an article I wrote on how to design a successful dashboard: <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/5-tips-for-designing-a-better-dashboard-69a82526184b" class="black-me"><b>https://blog.prototypr.io/5-tips-for-designing-a-better-dashboard-69a82526184b</b></a>. </p>

					<p>This article was published in protypr.io, a leading design publication on Medium, and translated into indonesion by a designer at Paperpillar. Including the Indonesian translation of the article, which can be found here:<b> <a href="https://medium.com/insightdesign/tips-untuk-mendesain-dashboard-yang-efektif-dd4bf76a3a9e" class="black-me">https://medium.com/insightdesign/tips-untuk-mendesain-dashboard-yang-efektif-dd4bf76a3a9e</a> </b>, my article has been read over 5000 times and applauded (I’m not sure what this means, the recommend feature was much more straight forward) over 500 times.</p>

					<p>Working on the Data and Analytics team at Mastercard was a great time for me because it intersected my interests in data science and UI design. Coming away from this internship, I feel like I have a stronger grasp on both what data science looks like outside of the classroom, and on how to tell the stories within data sets through visualization.</p>
