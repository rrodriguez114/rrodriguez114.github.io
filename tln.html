			<h1> Designing and Building the TLN's Video Platform</h1>

			<h3> How can we empower Mastercard employees with videos on the latest tech?</h3>

			<p>Outside of my work with the Data and Analytics team at Mastercard, I also worked with Technology Leadership Network (TLN), a business resource group within Mastercard focused on fostering a community within Mastercard focused on the sharing of knowledge. In order to support the knowledge sharing, the TLN posted videos on Mastercard’s internal video platform, MCTV. The TLN wanted their own platform, which would exclusively host their own video content by porting it over from MCTV. I worked with another intern to take this project from a problem statement to a coded up site.</p>

			<p>This project was segmented into two parts. First, we had to design the platform. Because this project was outside the traditional team infrastructure, I was actually able to lead and take ownership of this portion of the project. The second part of the project was implementing the design. Given that my background was more design focused and the intern I was working with came from a front-end background, I took a backseat during this part of the project, and worked to implement my teammate’s decisions.</p>

			<h3>Problem</h3>

			<p>If your goal is to watch a live broadcast of an executive speaking, MCTV is a great platform. If you are trying to do anything else, it is not a great time. Given that most of the videos on MCTV are of C-level executives speaking, and that the TLN is the only channel on the platform besides the official Mastercard channel that posts the videos of the executives speaking, I’d hazard a guess that MCTV was originally designed with the purpose of allowing employees to either tune into or watch at a later date company wide meetings such as townhalls. Then, when the TLN wanted to upload their own original content, Mastercard tacked on the functionality to support this.</p>
			
			<p>Likely a result of the repurposing of the site, many key features of a good video platform are missing from MCTV. This made viewing, or even finding, the content that the TLN posted difficult and unpleasant. For the TLN to be successful, this needed to change. The TLN figured that it would be easier to create their own platform to host their videos than push for a redesign of MCTV. This is where our project began.</p>
			
			<h3>Research </h3>

			<p>The first step to figuring out what the new TLN video platform should look like was figuring out what members of the TLN wanted to get out of the video content in the first place. We gathered user research through two streams: interviews and analysis of the videos’ view data. We looked to user interviews to get an understanding of what the members of the TLN looked like in Mastercard. Who were they? What were their professional goals? How can the TLN help them accomplish this with their video content? We looked to the data to see what videos were or weren’t getting watched to get an understanding of how the members of the TLN currently interacted with its video content.</p>
			
			<p>From our user interviews, we learned that members of the TLN were generally young employees within their first 5 years of the company. Of the TLN members we were referred to interview, all had recently graduated college, and were taking their first steps in their career at Mastercard. Multiple of them had previously interned for Mastercard before coming aboard as full time hires. They viewed the TLN as a way for them to advance their careers by staying on the cutting edge of what’s going on within their field. The two main ways that the TLN helped them do this was through sponsoring learning pathways on Degreed, an online curriculum platform similar to Coursera, and through the creation of field related “guilds”, such as the User Experience and User Interface Guild, that met once or twice a month to discuss relevant happenings within the field and host instructional events. While the TLN hosted many other events and initiatives, these were the two resources people most appreciated.</p>

			<p>After determining that members looked to the TLN primarily to help them advance their careers, we began looking at how the views on the TLN’s channel on MCTV were distributed amongst the posted videos. From this, we hoped to see how the goals of the members translated into their behavior. The first thing we noticed was that as a whole the videos were not very viewed, with an average of about 17 views. We hypothesized that this was because awareness of the video channel was low, and MCTV’s layout made organically discovering these videos difficult.</p>

			<p>What was interesting to us in how the views were distributed as that the only two tutorial style videos had over 100 views each. Additionally, the videos of guild meetings all had a solid following, with twenty to thirty views per video. Videos outside of these two categories were significantly less popular. </p>

			<p>From this information about what people wanted to get out of the TLN, and how the views were distributed, we formed an initial hypothesis about the user journey. We suspected that people came to the site knowing what they wanted were looking for, whether it be their most guild meeting or to see if there’s a video about a new technology they are interested or a video about a task they are stuck on. </p>

			<p>Before making any decisions based on this hypothesized journey, we wanted to do our best to either disprove or validate it. We sent a follow up email to the people we interviewed asking them how many videos they watched at one time. 4 out of the 5 people said they watched one video at a time, while one said that they generally watch a couple in a row when working on something that requires less than their full attention. Given that most people only watch one video at a time, we decided that this was evidenced our hypothesis that people came knowing what they wanted to watch.</p>

			<h3>Ideation, Experimentation and Iteration</h3>

			<p>Now that we felt like we had a good enough understanding of what users wanted, how they behaved, and what their journey looked like, the next step was figuring out how to make that journey as easy possible. If people come to the site with the goal of finding one video that they already know they want to watch, then the best thing that we can do for them is to make it as easy as possible for them to find the video that they are looking.</p>

			<p>One inherently challenging part of this design was the fact that due to inconsistencies in the way the videos had been uploaded to MCTV, we could not use a search feature. So the question became, how can we make navigating to a single video as easy as possible when users can’t search for it?</p>

			<p>To figure out the best way to organize the site, we began building prototypes. Starting with paper fidelity, we built prototypes of two screens. We prototyped the initial landing screen, and then the screen users find reach once clicking the video. Our main focus was the home screen, as this is where the variety of the navigation occurs.</p>

			<p>We hypothesized from the beginning that some sort of spotlight section, where the TLN could highlight the videos people were most likely to watch at any given time, would be useful in guiding users to desired video. This would allow users to quickly find popular videos such as a particularly popular tutorial video. We included this in all of our initial prototypes. To evaluate the other portions of the prototypes, we asked users to accomplish a variety of different tasks. </p>

			<p>Our original designs were focused on organizing the videos by 3 categories of videos that the head of the TLN suggested, and using a combination of filters to narrow down and sort the listed videos to the one the users were looking for. The categories suggested were “professional”, “mastercard official”, and “community gumbo.”</p>
			
			<p>We ran into issues when people didn’t understand the meanings of the categories, or if they did understand the meaning, were unsure what category a video would be placed. In hindsight it does seem obvious that these titles, especially “community gumbo”, would be problematic. Even if we were hesitant to immediately veto our superior’s suggestion, we eventually did pivot away from his suggested categories, and had a stronger case to do so because we took the time to do usability testing first. </p>

			<p>Referring back to the idea that we were trying to make the videos as easy to navigate to as possible, we hypothesized that perhaps the front page should not be organized by category, but be organized by what people are most likely to watch. Still using paper prototypes, together with the other intern, we tested many different ideas before founding a design that users could consistently follow.</p>

			<p>After finding a design that allowed users to successfully complete our navigation tasks, we increased the fidelity we worked in, moving to Figma. Our new design segmented the landing page into 3 portions. It retained the spotlight video section from the previous iteration because we believed that it was useful for making  the videos that people most wanted to watch immediately visible. We then added a “recent videos” which contained the 5 most recently uploaded videos. We added this to capture videos such as guild meetings that are regularly uploaded and have a strong following, but are unlikely to warrant the spotlight section because they are universally useful. Underneath that, we included an “all videos” section, where the videos were sorted by the number of views they had. The first 20 most viewed videos were visible, while the rest could be viewed through pagination.</p>

			<p>Before moving to implement our design, we held one last round of user testing. Using Invision, we linked our Figma screens together to create a clickable prototype. We had users attempt to accomplish the same tasks as we had on the previous round of usability testing, and users were able to accomplish most tasks successfully. I think both moving to mode of interaction that users were more familiar with, and a the new design played a role in the higher levels of success in this round of testing than in the paper prototype round.  However, where people struggled was finding videos that were not contained in either the spotlight video section, recent video section, or first page of the all video section. This was a challenge to solve because traditionally, this is when you would use a search bar to find a video. </p>
			
			<p>Given that we could not include a search bar in our design, we looked to eliminate the need for one by preempting what users would search for. We created a sticky side navigation bar that was organized by the initiatives of the TLN, and by its guilds. This way, instead of searching “UX guild” to find the videos that guild had posted, they could just click the link that would take them there.</p>

			<h3>Implementation</h3> 

			<p>My favorite thing about this project was that we weren’t just designing for the sake of designing, we also got to implement our design. After our final design was approved, we began coding. The TLN hosts its wiki on confluence, which is a wiki service that companies can purchase from Atlassian. We were asked to port our design into the TLN’s confluence wiki. </p>

			<p>To do this, we first created a skeleton website outside of confluence using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then, we ported our code into Confluence using the HTML, CSS, and Script macros, which allow for the importing of custom code.<p>

			<p>Once we had our code imported there were two issues. First, confluence automatically adds a comment section to the bottom. On the landing page, this doesn’t make sense, and on the comments page we wanted to make our own comments section. Additionally, the confluence platform utilizes a side navigation of its own for navigation. While in many cases this may be useful, the TLN use of it is more confusing than helpful. We inserted javascript into the original source code to remove both of these features.</p>

			<p>Before we could continue any further, the head of the TLN actually left Mastercard, putting our project on hold. While we were largely finished with our project, as we were focused only on the design and front end implementation, we were not able to configure the page to load a video as it is selected. Currently, there is a clickable but not fully functional version of our design on the TLN wiki. To allow for a smooth handoff when a new head of the TLN is appointed, we documented our code and sent it to our TLN mentors.</p>

			<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>

			<p>The largest tradeoffs we made throughout this project was sacrificing depth of research and testing for continuous forward progress. We began this project in our third week of the 10 week internship, and were looking to both design and implement the new product. 7 weeks is not a lot of time to move a project from start to finish.</p>

			<p>There were definitely times where I would have loved to do more research or testing. For example, we based our design off of just one user desire. With further research, we likely would have been able to uncover either deeper or additional user needs. However, you can spend all the time you want on designing a site, if that site never gets created, then the time spent on design was for naught. To make sure that we were going to be able to code our design, we at times sacrificed additional research and testing. </p>

			<h3>Reflections</h3>

			<p>We could have worked harder to find critics and mentors. Taking the initiative to find voices to challenge and guide our design decision would have led to stronger design decisions.</p>

			<p>My favorite thing about the TLN’s video platform project was the extent to which I got to own its design. We reported directly up to the head of the TLN, with no senior designer or developer supervising us. This provided a great opportunity to learn by doing. However, I think that the overall design could likely be stronger if we took the initiative to find a senior designer to critique our work. During the user research portion of the project, we worked with a useability specialist to help us gather better research. During the design portion of the process, I think we tunnel vision-ed a little too much on moving towards implementation, and not enough on challenging the decsions we were making at the time.<p>
