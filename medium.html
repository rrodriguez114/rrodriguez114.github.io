					<p><b>For three summers before I had a real internship, I was camp counselor at a local camp called Rec-PAC</b>. This club focused on providing a semi-educational summer camp for families that otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford to send their kids anywhere over the summer. While I knew that eventually I would have to find a real job, I really value the time that I spent there. One of my favorite things about my time with Rec-PAC was the fact that I was able to make a real impact on the kids I worked with.  While desk jobs have a lot to offer, I’ll definitely miss the feeling of waking up and getting paid to make people smile.</p>

					<p>What I took away from this was that <b>I find impacting others very rewarding</b>. I’d like to be a voice in my industry one day, and I figured I might as well start taking steps toward this now. I figured that there are two main steps to having my voice heard. First, I need to have something to say. Second, I people need to listen to what I have to say.</p>
			
					<p>I began writing on Medium about design in the summer of 2017. I figured if I worked first on figuring out what I had to say, people would listen once what I was saying was interesting. So far I’ve written <b>3 articles</b>, been published in <b>1 publication</b>, and just <b>over 190 strangers thought what I had to say was interesting enough to follow my writing.</b></p>
